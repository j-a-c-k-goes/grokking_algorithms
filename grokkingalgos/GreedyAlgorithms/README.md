# Greedy Algorithms

## Objectives
* Tackling problems which have no fast algorithmic solution(s) â€” NP-complete problems.
* Identifying NP-complete problems.
* Becoming aware of approximation algorithms. 
* Learning about the greedy strategy, a problem-solving strategy.

## How to schedule as many classes as possible ( in one classroom ).
* Pick the class that ends the soonest.
* Pick a class that starts after the first class and has the soonest end-time.

## What is a greedy algorithm?
A greedy algorithm chooses the optimal solution at each step of the algorithm. In constrast, a lazy algorithm would choose the least optimal solution @ any given step. 

Greedy algorithms are not always ideal, though!
