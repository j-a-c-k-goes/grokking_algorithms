# Recursion
 
## Definition
* Recursion is when a function calls itself.  
* A recursive function has a base case and recursive case.
* Recursion is used to make solutions clearer.

## Why it is Effective
* Binary searching effectively eliminates half the guesses needed until finding a target. 
* Example: Searching a list of one-million integers for the integer 200 requires 18 steps to locate the item. 
* Doing this with a simple search could take <= then length of the item set ,which is inefficient.  

## Limitations
* Mishandled base cases can result in infinite loops and a stack which has been piled too high. 
* There is no performance benefit to using recursion.
