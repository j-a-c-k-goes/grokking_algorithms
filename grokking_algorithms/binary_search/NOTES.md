# Binary Search 

## Definition
* Binary search is an algorithm dependent upon a sorted input, like a list if elements. 
* If the element is contained within the list, a binary search will return the position the element's location. 

## Why it is Effective
* Binary searching effectively eliminates half the guesses needed until finding a target. 
* Example: Searching a list of one-million integers for the integer 200 requires 18 steps to locate the item. 
* Doing this with a simple search could take <= then length of the item set ,which is inefficient.  

## Limitations
* Binary search works only on sorted lists.
